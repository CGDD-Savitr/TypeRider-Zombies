# Type Rider

## About the game

### General

* The game is an infinite runner with typing controls.
* You take control of a spirit that is stuck in some kind glitch in the space-time continuum.

### Controls

* Move by typing the displayed keywords and pressing 'Enter', the direction is shown by arrows on the HUD.
* You can erase letters with 'Backspace', or erase an incomplete keyword with 'Enter'.
* Hold 'Spacebar' to fast-forward.
* Press 'Escape' while playing to pause the game.
* If power-ups are available, use them by pressing '1', '2' or '3'. This is shown on the HUD.

### Mechanics

* Obstacles damage you, avoid them. A healthbar is shown on the HUD.
* Score increases in two ways:
	* By picking up coins.
	* By surviving. Score is added non-stop based on your current velocity.
* The difficulty setting affects four things:
	* Initial velocity.
	* Acceleration (your velocity increases over time so you will lose eventually).
	* Score multiplier.
	* The length of the keywords.
* Power-ups can be picked up, here are some details:
	* They are not activated automatically.
	* Once picked up, activate them at any time with '1', '2, or '3'.
	* You can only have one of each type of power-up at any time.
* Using power-ups helps you survive, there are three types:
	* Invulnerability: Become invulnerable for a few seconds. Keybind: '1'.
	* Slow-motion: Slow time for a few seconds. Keybind: '2'.
	* WASD: Move freely for a few seconds with the WASD or arrow keys. Keybind: '3'.
* Keywords:
	* Correct letters are highlighted green.
	* Wrong letters are highlighted red.
	* Letters that go past the length of the word are displayed as red asterisks.
